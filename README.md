# Night-at-a-Museum
It is a Virtual Reality application developed for google cardboard in which user can experience a virtual museum and also navigate around  the scene üåÉ 

As a part of the Udacity VR Nanodegree, this project is intended to introduce students to different markets and purposes for which VR is currently being developed.

The goal was to create a cohesive ‚Äú mobile virtual reality experience with ‚Äòinformation booths‚Äô which include both visual and audio feedback for users‚Äù. The gathered information could be about VR companies, VR applications, or potential industries that could be impacted by VR.

The experience is designed as an information system offered by a college basically medical college, ‚ÄòMedical & Education and VR.

The user can go around the the different Display panel to learn about different ways VR can be used for Medical and Educaton purposes & Military and some of the companies currently producing applications.

## Experience Description
You start in a Space with start experience button after clicking strat it will enter a vr exhibition . Inside it, there are a lot of things to interact with and learn new things.

## Project Breakdown

### Statement of purpose

‚ÄúNight at the Museum‚Äô is a mobile VR application for beginners, allowing them to learn about the different ways they can include VR in their learning and industry.‚Äù

## User Testing

### Test 1: Scale

The first round of user testing I conducted was validating the scaling. I performed many quick builds onto my phone to adjust the scale with the environment, height, etc. Once I felt like it was at a good place, I presented it with another user. They confirmed that the scaling was accurate.

### Test 2: UI Design
The second round of user testing involved testing the UI designs and validate that the interaction worked well. A small update to the position on the play/stop button on one of the UI‚Äôs was needed, but everything else seemed right.

### Test 3: Locomation
This tested moving between the waypoints. From a design perspective, I decided to go with waypoints for my method of locomotion for two reasons:

- Movement from one location to the next is instantaneous
- It‚Äôs quick

Given the high number of waypoints in the scene, I felt it was important to have movement quick, but without any chance of locomotion sickness. I tested this with two users, and they did not have any issues.

### Test 4: Final Playthrough
